# Portfolio-Website
My first ever coding project built using ReactJS and Sanity.

## Background / Situation
After going through some coding tutorials, I felt it's time to see what I can create at this point.
  
  
## Solution / Action
As I didn't have a portfolio website, I decided to get my hands dirty building one for my personal use.  
  
  
## Things need to be addressed 
- Make the code DRY
- Refine the code and design
  
- Carousel won't be properly rendered if the user changes the browser width after the page is loaded.
